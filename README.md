# UltrasonicSensor
This Arduino program utilizes an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to measure distances. It sends an ultrasonic pulse and calculates the distance based on the time it takes for the pulse to bounce back. The program continuously displays the distance on the Arduino Serial Monitor, providing real-time distance update
